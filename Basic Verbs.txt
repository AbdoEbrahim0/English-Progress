after paraphrase 
Shantel and Todd were talking about what they were doing over the weekend. Shantel wakes up and prepares her food. 
She especially like toast and butter. Todd, on the other hand, enjoys eating toast with butter and jam. 
She also enjoys that. She used to eat cereal, but not now. Todd doesn't eat cereal on weekends, but he normally does on rest days. 
What are you doing after breakfast? Shantel cleaned the kitchen, washed the dishes, organized her room, and made the bed. 
Todd does the same despite vacuuming, laundry, window washing, and housecleaning. What are you doing on Sunday? 
Todd relaxes. He enjoys himself when he orders meals or goes to a restaurant.
He goes hiking, to the park, plays soccer in the park, and occasionally rides his bike. 
He does a lot on Sundays. He doesn't work, study, cook, or clean his home. Shantel prepares a delicious breakfast, explores new cities, travels with her pals,
 and eats a lot of extremely wonderful cuisine while camping.
 Do you enjoy camping? I enjoy camping, being outside, and trekking on a regular basis. 
How about Sunday evening? Shantel prepares a large dinner, sleeps early, listens to music, and occasionally reads a book. 
Todd watched the TV show Billions on Sunday night. It discusses money, power, and New York.
