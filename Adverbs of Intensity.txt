After paraphrase Checker:
Todd and Natalie They were discussing the nations they had visited.
 Todd resides in Japan, and the cost of living there is a challenge.
 It's a very costly country, with high transportation costs, high food costs,

 The cost of everything is exorbitant, including trains. He finds it odd that vehicles are inexpensive yet cabs are pricey.
 He is employed as a teacher of English. Both the people and the pupils are really pleasant. 
She questioned him about the difficulties he faced there. He responded that because kanji contains roughly 2,000 letter characters, Japanese is quite challenging. She concurred with his assertion that owning a car is costly in the UK, but taxis are inexpensive. 
He goes on to talk about Japan.
Its beautiful landscapes, exquisite temples, and magnificent woodlands make it a very pleasant country.
 He asked whether she lived in Thailand. What did you find challenging about residing there? 
Thailand is a really beautiful and affordable place to live. Restaurants are pricey, but transportation is really inexpensive. The street food there is excellent and reasonably priced. The rice with pork and hot chili is my favorite Thai dish. another dish that resembles a hot soup.
 Typically, it comes with chile, shrimp, and mushrooms. The challenging aspect is the too crowded transportation system. 
It's a busy road. Getting somewhere takes a long time. To get where she wants to go, she typically takes the SkyTrain or subway system.
She occasionally arrives late to work, though, because the train is packed with passengers. and what Todd said about Japan.
He wanted to know about Thai people. People who respond to her are quite response. TheyÂ always prefer to hang out.
